# Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.
This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Section 1
Initially, I began by writing a simple program for text validation. It involved a user typing a letter in the hope of guessing a letter that is within a randomly chosen word selected my the computer. The word selected will be one of 5 words within a list of fruits.  The code involves text validation to ensure the letter that is inputted is 1 alphabetical character , or the user will be asked to try again.

The nexy step was to use object orientated programming to implement 'lives' into the program. Users begin with 5 lives unless they choose to change this and are asked to guess a letter for the hidden word.
